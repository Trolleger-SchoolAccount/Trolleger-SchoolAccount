    <h1>Simple Light & Quick Spaghetti Recipe</h1>
    <p>This recipe is for a <strong>simple</strong>, <em>light</em>, and <strong>quick spaghetti</strong> dish you can
        make in a pinch! It's designed for one medium portion, but you can adjust the quantities as needed. Check out
        the image at the bottom for a visual reference.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 ounces (one medium handful) of dry spaghetti</li>
        <li>6 cups of water (or more, if desired)</li>
        <li>A pinch of salt (optional)</li>
        <li>A tablespoon of oil (optional)</li>
        <li>300 milliliters of milk</li>
        <li>1-2 ounces of cream cheese, feta cheese, or a mix of similar cheeses</li>
        <li>Tomato sauce (optional)</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper (to taste)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a pot, bring 6 cups of water to a boil over high heat.</li>
        <li>Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and add the spaghetti, along with the pinch of salt and the
            tablespoon of oil.</li>
        <li>If your spaghetti is too long, don't worry! It will soften in the water. Stir every 2-3 minutes to prevent
            sticking, ensuring the spaghetti is fully submerged.</li>
        <li>Cook for 10-15 minutes, or until the spaghetti is soft.</li>
        <li>Strain the spaghetti and set it aside in the strainer or return it to the pot.</li>
        <li>Add the milk, cheeses, and any additional seasonings to the pot. Mix until it becomes creamy. You can also
            return the strained spaghetti to the pot at this point.</li>
        <li>Combine the spaghetti with the sauce, ensuring the cheese coats the pasta evenly.</li>
        <li>Serve in a bowl or on a plate. Top with parmesan, tomato sauce, fresh tomatoes, or any other desired
            toppings. Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
